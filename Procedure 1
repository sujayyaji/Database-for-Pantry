*/Donors make donations to the pantry. Donors table records name, 
contact number, address, description, and email of the donors. This procedure is used to 
classify the donors based on the monetary donations. The procedure uses a cursor to loop
through all entries in donors table. It first finds the total number of monetary donations 
and total estimated value of all “in kind” (food) donations for a donor in the current year. 
If the donation is greater than or equal to 5000 then they are classified as Gold. If the donation 
is greater than or equal to 1000 then they are classified as Silver and if the donation is less than 
1000, they are classified as Bronze. Finally, the procedure updates donorlevel column as Gold, Silver,
or Bronze based on the donor’s total amount donated for the current year.*/
