--the count of students visiting the campus pantry is greater than 1. 
--In the second clause, the total number of students visiting the pantry is obtained. 
--Finally, the percent is obtained from the orders and the number of students repeating
--and coalesce is used to round it off to the nearest integer. 
--This query provides the change in percent for each month in the data and thus helps to improve business operations in the future
