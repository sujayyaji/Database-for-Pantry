--First, we create 36 index numbers from 0 to 35
--Then, in YEARMONTH with clause we go 36 months back to count percent change for the last two years from current date.
--Then, we use lag function to get Last Month and Last Year Same month values for Quantity in one row for
--that corresponding combination of month and year.
--Then, we calculate the percent change by using formula: (current value - previous value) / (previous value) * 100
--Then we restrict the data to last 13 entries to get results only for the last 2 years from current date.
