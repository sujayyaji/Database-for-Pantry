*/In this procedure, we are trying to replicate changes 
in one table across multiple tables. Whenever we generate a 
purchase order, we have to insert product items in the weightordered table. 
Weight for those items can be found from products master table and we take that 
unit weight and multiple it with the weight stored. This is weight that goes into
the warehousestock. So every insert in weightordered bumps up the warehousestock.
This bumped up warehouse stock has to reflect changes in some warehouse which is how we
take the input warehouseid and update wquantity stored with weight equivalent to  (wqs + WEIGHTSTOREDT)*/
