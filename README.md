# Database-for-Pantry
The following repository contains code in Oracle SQL for a database that we built. The ER diagram was created on MS Visio,
queries and triggers were written according to the needs of the client. A brief explanation is also provided at the end of each query.
The best way to understand the whole projet is to go through the Data Dictionary and the ER Diagram so that the tables and the data
make sense.
